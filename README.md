# Leaflet Challenge

## Overview
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## Directory
- `static` contains the .css and .js files used to run the visualizations
- `index.html` contains the .html file used to present the web page.

## Deliverables
### Create an Earthquake Visualization
- Data gathering from USGS
    - Last 7 days of earthquake data in JSON format
- Import and visualize the data using leaflet
    - Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
    - Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
